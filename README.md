# Diamond Price Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting diamond prices based on various attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and size. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model aims to provide accurate price estimations to aid buyers and sellers in the diamond industry.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains key attributes of diamonds, including:
- **Carat**: Weight of the diamond.
- **Cut**: Quality of the cut (e.g., Ideal, Premium, Good, etc.).
- **Color**: Grading from D (best) to J (worst).
- **Clarity**: Measurement of inclusions and blemishes.
- **Depth & Table**: Proportions affecting the diamond's brilliance.
- **Price**: The target variable representing the price of the diamond.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Data Processing, Model Training, and Evaluation)
- **Pandas** (Data Handling)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn & XGBoost** (Machine Learning Models)

## ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Models Implemented
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
